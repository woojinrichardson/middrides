## An app for Middlebury College's evening transportation service.

Since much of the app is inaccessible to those without a middlebury.edu email, I have included demos of the app from the perspective of a user and from the perspective of the driver's assistant, as well as a demo of the real-time location tracking of the bus.

### User Demo
